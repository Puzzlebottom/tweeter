# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
4. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
5. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.
6. Tweet yo'self!

## Features

### An elegant UI experience for the discerning user

Built with love; styled with *Sass*.<br/>

It's the lastest in understated design from our world class team...<br/>
Heh, just kidding. It's a meticulous pixel by pixel re-creation of an LHL educational demo.<br/>

It's blue, it's yellow, and it's got an animated arrow thing!

### Streamlined interface for maximum tweetitude

One input and a button. If we made it any easier we'd need a direct neural interface.

### Direct Neural Interface!

### The comforting safety net of form field validation

By integrating the [Jquery.validation](https://jqueryvalidation.org/) plugin, we managed to kill three birds 
with one stone (that's the tweet you heard). It handles our user input validation, displays error messages on 
invalid inputs, and fires our custom submit handler when everything checks out!<br/>

Check out an example error message below:

If a user tried to tweet an empty tweet, an error like this would glide seamlessly into view. What a good way 
to alert the user to the fact that they've somehow messed up this exceedingly simple task.

### Brevity is the soul of wit, let's make it mandatory!

Tend to ramble a bit? Track the length of your tweets dynamically with this handy character counter.<br/>
It turns red to let you know that you're boring the people around you!

If you try to ignore the counter, **YOU CAN'T.**

It'll display this error message when you try to tweet:

### Nothing like a slick layout to distract from your insufferable banality...

Your friends will say WOW! and think you're interesting.

Look, it's got a little avatar, and your name! There's little icons in the corner; they change color!<br/>
It even has a box-shadow effect when you hover you mouse (you can't see it now, dummy, this is just a screenshot)<br/>

And the pièce de résistance: there's a text-shadow on the user's handle when you hover on the tweet.  It's 
ridiculously subtle -- so subtle you probably didn't see it.  I'll bet whoever built this assignment for LHL
didn't expect anyone to notice.  But I noticed, and replicated it here.  Because I'm an effing pedant.

### Navigational shortcuts abound!

Speak of the button and it doth appear.  Well, scroll down and it doth appear.<br/>
Just thought of a funny rejoinder? An irresistable bon mot? Click the big red button and it takes you back 
up to the top and focuses your cursor in the go-make-tweet form.

### Take it to go with responsive mobile interfaces!

Phone, tablet, desktop.  It doesn't matter!  With a responsive design this glorious app rea-mah-rranges itself to
preserve the singular user experience you'd expect from a locally run Single Page App with no persistence!
